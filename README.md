# 🚓 GTA Clone — Open-World Crime Sandbox Prototype

**GTA Clone** is a third-person open-world action game prototype inspired by the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series. Built using **[Unity / Unreal Engine]*, the game replicates key mechanics such as free-roaming, vehicle control, basic AI, and mission logic in a sandbox city environment.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This prototype focuses on implementing core systems like player movement, driving, combat, and AI from scratch using **Blueprints / C#**. The project emphasizes modular gameplay logic, world interaction, and mission flow over graphical fidelity—serving as a learning and experimentation platform for open-world design.
